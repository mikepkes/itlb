Is The Laser Busy

A project for VHSers to practice Node/Javascript skills and help make something awesome!

This project was originally started by Mike Kessler (@mikepkes on Slack/Talk) as a learning project and he has since donated it to VHS as a group learning/hacking project for others to continue.

Fork the code, make something awesome, submit a pull request and we'll get it deployed on the VHS server!
